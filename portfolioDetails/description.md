# Dyslexic Essay Assistance

This project was built to support my brother and sister, both of whom have dyslexia, in improving their college courses. Faced with challenges in their academic writing, I created this tool to provide AI-driven grammar and spell checks, statement reorganization for clarity, and voice input to make the process more accessible. 

The project was developed in just 2 hours as a self-initiated hack, demonstrating rapid prototyping skills and a focus on immediate user needs. It was built using Angular Material for a responsive, clean UI.
